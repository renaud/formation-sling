**form.ation** is a web application to create and design html forms. The created forms can then be used to create, view and edit content.

## About ##

form.ation is build with the [Apache Sling](http://incubator.apache.org/sling/) web framework, using [Day's CRX](http://dev.day.com) . For more information about the architecture, see the README on the right.

form.ation is inspired by Drupal's CCK module. I wrote form.ation to learn more about Apache Sling and jQuery. form.ation has been submitted to [Day's JCR cup](http://dev.day.com/microsling/content/blogs/cup.c.html)
